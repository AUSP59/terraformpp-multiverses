# Project Governance

OmniForge uses a meritocratic, community-driven model:
- Maintainers are selected based on contribution history.
- Major decisions require RFC proposals and 2+ approvals.
- Conflicts are resolved by consensus and documented.
- All discussions happen transparently via public issues.
